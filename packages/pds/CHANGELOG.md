## 0.15.2

### Patch Changes

- [#165](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/165) [`5e058c8`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/5e058c8d7141391c761693de53bb6b1a8bb11a74) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix blob uploads intermittently desyncing the PDS from the relay.

  Uploading a blob (commonly a link-card thumbnail) could occasionally fail and leave the relay no longer tracking the repo, so new posts stopped federating until a manual crawl request. Blob uploads are now reliable and no longer drop the firehose connection.

### Patch Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/157) [`241a5fc`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/241a5fc58baa429c3938c0b99f9afdd9d5c85dce) Thanks [@NuroDev](https://github.com/NuroDev)! - fix(pds): Remove empty collections from cache on record delete.

  When all records of a collection are deleted, it is now ensured that the collection is deleted from the user repository so collections don't linger around forever

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- [#160](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/160) [`a492bf7`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/a492bf71e6c6e9c174617a98931ec005e07abbc8) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Lexicon validation now matches the reference PDS more closely:
  - `createRecord`, `putRecord`, and `applyWrites` honor the `validate` flag from the request body. `true` requires a known schema, `false` skips schema validation, `undefined` validates known schemas optimistically.
  - Responses include `validationStatus` (`"valid"` for known, `"unknown"` for unknown collections; omitted when `validate: false`). Per-write `validationStatus` is returned in `applyWrites` results.
  - The record's `$type` is filled in from `collection` when missing and rejected on mismatch.
  - Generic record-key shape (`isRecordKey`) is enforced for any provided rkey, regardless of `validate` flag — closes a hole where empty-string and path-traversal-style rkeys could reach the repo.
  - Schema-specific record keys are validated against the schema's `keySchema` for known collections (e.g. `app.bsky.feed.post` requires a TID, `app.bsky.actor.profile` requires `self`).
  - Legacy `{ cid, mimeType }` blob refs are rejected.
  - Bundled schema set broadened to include `com.atproto.lexicon.schema`, `app.bsky.actor.status`, `app.bsky.notification.declaration`, and `chat.bsky.actor.declaration`.
  - The Durable Object is now the authoritative rkey allocator: when the client doesn't supply an rkey, the worker validates against a candidate (so restrictive `keySchema`s still reject early) and the DO picks the final rkey against its MST state, with a small retry loop to defeat any worker-isolate clockid collisions.
  - Client-supplied rkey collisions return `409 RecordAlreadyExists` instead of a generic 500.
  - Intra-batch duplicate rkeys in `applyWrites` return `400 InvalidRequest` (distinguished from the 409 above).
  - Missing rkey for `applyWrites#update`/`#delete` returns `400 InvalidRequest`.
  - Non-boolean `validate` flag values return `400 InvalidRequest`.
  - Non-string `rkey` values (including `null`) return `400 InvalidRequest`.

### Patch Changes

- [#162](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/162) [`5920074`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/5920074d3d1b12935c9e6ef014e422b3e2e503ec) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix relay desync after a failed write (e.g. an image post that errors mid-flight).

  `applyWrites` was assigning the new `Repo` to in-memory state before sequencing the firehose event. If anything threw between then and `sequenceCommit` succeeding, Cloudflare rolled back the SQLite writes but the in-memory `Repo` stayed advanced. The next successful write then emitted a firehose commit whose `since` rev the relay had never seen, and the relay marked the repo desynced — requiring a manual `requestCrawl` to recover.

  `this.repo` is now only assigned after the sequence + broadcast succeed, and any failure in that window invalidates the in-memory cache so the next access reloads from storage.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#158](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/158) [`ec935b1`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/ec935b16b7f44b22ff325781e0c88ccc3d07e599) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Support granular OAuth permissions and permission sets per the atproto permission spec.
  - `repo:`, `rpc:`, `blob:`, `account:`, `identity:` scopes are parsed and enforced (via `@atproto/oauth-scopes`); `transition:generic` / `transition:email` / `transition:chat.bsky` keep working through the transitional shim.
  - `verifyAccessToken` now accepts a `(perms) => p.assertRepo({ collection, action })`-style check callback in addition to the legacy required-scope string.
  - PDS write endpoints (`createRecord`, `putRecord`, `deleteRecord`, `applyWrites`, `uploadBlob`) assert the matching scope before dispatching.
  - `include:NSID?aud=...` permission-set scopes are resolved via `@atcute/lexicon-resolver` and expanded inline at code-issuance time, so resource-server checks never need network access. The PDS caches resolved permission sets in DO SQLite with the spec's stale-while-revalidate semantics (24h soft / 90d hard).
  - The consent UI groups long granular-scope lists by NSID authority and collapses them behind a `<details>` disclosure, so a 30-scope client like tangled.org renders as a few audit-friendly lines instead of a wall of text. `include:` scopes render the resolved bundle's title/detail.

  **Note on legacy auth:** session JWTs (from `createSession` / app-password flow), service JWTs, and the static `AUTH_TOKEN` continue to bypass scope checks at resource handlers — they're treated as fully-trusted callers per their original semantics (app-password equivalents). The new `rpc:` proxy enforcement only applies to OAuth (`DPoP`) tokens; legacy clients can still call any AppView method via the proxy regardless of granular scopes.

- [#155](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/155) [`d1a7074`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/d1a70748126870274980d76e230719e29f408290) Thanks [@a-lavis](https://github.com/a-lavis)! - Fix two OAuth token refresh bugs that prevented spec-compliant clients (e.g. tangled.org via indigo) from refreshing their session after the access token expired.
  - Track access and refresh expiry separately on `TokenData` (`accessExpiresAt` / `refreshExpiresAt`) instead of a single `expiresAt`. `cleanup()` now prunes by `refreshExpiresAt`, so a row isn't deleted while its refresh token is still valid. The PDS SQLite store migrates legacy `oauth_tokens` rows in place, deriving `refresh_expires_at` as `MAX(expires_at, issued_at + REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL)`.
  - The PDS auth middleware now sends `WWW-Authenticate: DPoP error="invalid_token"` on 401 responses for invalid/expired OAuth access tokens, as required by the atproto XRPC spec. Clients that gate refresh on this header (indigo, and others) will now refresh automatically instead of staying logged-in-but-broken until the user signs out.

  Messaging platforms (Telegram, Slack, Discord, Twitter/X, Facebook/iMessage) pre-fetch URLs shared in DMs and channels. When an OAuth authorization link with a one-time PAR request URI is shared, the preview bot consumes it before the user can open it. The authorize endpoint now detects these specific bots by User-Agent and returns a minimal HTML page with appropriate meta tags instead of processing the OAuth request.

  Only known messaging platform bots are matched — generic crawlers and spiders are not excluded, since an unknown bot hitting an OAuth URL should still consume the token.

  Incoming API records contain blob references with nested `$link` objects
  (for example, `{ "$type": "blob", "ref": { "$link": "bafk..." } }`). These
  must be converted to actual CID instances before CBOR encoding, otherwise
  the blob ref's `ref` field gets encoded as a map instead of a proper CID tag.
  This causes incorrect block hashes, which can lead to blob resolution failures
  on the Bluesky network.

  Uses `jsonToLex` from `@atproto/lex-json` to convert `$link` → CID and
  `$bytes` → Uint8Array on all record write paths (createRecord, putRecord,
  applyWrites).

  - Added `DATA_LOCATION` environment variable for controlling DO placement
  - Supports `eu` jurisdiction (hard guarantee) and location hints (`wnam`, `enam`, `sam`, `weur`, `eeur`, `apac`, `oc`, `afr`, `me`)
  - Default is `auto` (no location constraint, recommended for most users)
  - Exported `DataLocation` type from package

  These features use Cloudflare's Durable Object data location capabilities. The `eu` jurisdiction provides compliance guarantees that data never leaves the EU, while hints are best-effort suggestions for latency optimization.

  Warning: Do not change this setting after initial deployment. It only affects newly-created DOs and will not migrate existing data.

  Fixes the authentication loss issue where Cirrus-hosted accounts would lose auth after ~2 hours, requiring users to switch accounts or reload the page to recover.

  **Root Cause:**
  The Bluesky client's `fetchHandler` specifically checks for HTTP 400 with error code `'ExpiredToken'` to trigger automatic token refresh. Cirrus was returning HTTP 401 with `'InvalidToken'`, which the client interpreted as "token is fundamentally broken" rather than "token expired, please refresh".

  **Fixes:**
  1. Return HTTP 400 with `'ExpiredToken'` for expired access tokens (matching official PDS)
  2. Added `TokenExpiredError` class to detect `jose.errors.JWTExpired` specifically
  3. Fixed JWT scope to use `'com.atproto.access'` (matching official PDS)
  4. Removed duplicate `jti` from refresh token payload
  5. Removed JWT `iss` claim to match official PDS
  6. Added `emailConfirmed` field to session responses

  Add support for the `com.atproto.sync.getRecord` endpoint, which returns a CAR file containing the commit block and all MST blocks needed to prove the existence (or non-existence) of a record. This enables tools like pdsls to verify record signatures.

  Reduces access token lifetime from 2 hours to 15 minutes to match the official Bluesky PDS implementation and AT Protocol OAuth specification (which recommends 1-5 minutes with a maximum of 1 hour).

  This fixes the periodic authentication loss issue where the Bluesky app and web interface would lose authentication and require account switching or page reload to recover. Short-lived tokens force regular refresh cycles, keeping sessions fresh and properly synchronized with the app's token management.

  Extended the service JWT expiry from 60 seconds to 5 minutes. This fixes video upload failures where larger videos would take longer than 60 seconds to process on video.bsky.app, causing the callback to your PDS to fail with 401 due to the expired JWT.

  Also enables observability in the Cloudflare Worker template for better debugging.

  When migrating from another PDS (like bsky.social), this new command handles the PLC directory update:
  - Requests a PLC operation signature from your source PDS via email token
  - Signs the operation with your new Cirrus signing key
  - Submits the signed operation to plc.directory

- [#57](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/57) [`20ca34d`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/20ca34d0170261f920ecde06a155f64688a134a4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Add `pds status` CLI command for comprehensive PDS health and configuration checks
  - Enhanced `/xrpc/_health` endpoint to verify Durable Object and SQLite storage health
  - New `pds status` command checks connectivity, repository state, identity resolution, blob import progress, federation status, and account activation
  - Shows DID resolution method (plc.directory or well-known) and handle verification method (DNS TXT and/or HTTP well-known)
  - Added authenticated `/xrpc/gg.mk.experimental.getFirehoseStatus` endpoint for firehose subscriber info

- [#62](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/62) [`af0fde8`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/af0fde8051024e62ba7c0f98cce53e2e91790b57) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Ping the Bluesky relay on account activation. The `pds activate` command now calls `com.atproto.sync.requestCrawl` on bsky.network to notify the relay that the PDS is ready for federation. If the account is already active, running `pds activate` again will offer to retry notifying the relay.

- [#56](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/56) [`fed94a4`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/fed94a462d817d23445dcb53654d6f1461b8781e) Thanks [@JackDallas](https://github.com/JackDallas)! - Add multi-account selection to `pds init` - detects multiple Cloudflare accounts via `wrangler whoami` and prompts user to select one

- [#58](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/58) [`adedb2b`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/adedb2b075f3a6819b1de03996eff3c9a1c618b9) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Respect user's package manager choice in CLI commands. All CLI commands (init, migrate, activate, deactivate) now detect and use the user's package manager consistently. Changed `wrangler deploy` references to use the appropriate package manager command (e.g., `pnpm run deploy`).

### Patch Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/ascorbic/atproto-worker/pull/35) [`735981d`](https://github.com/ascorbic/atproto-worker/commit/735981d036938e8ee6416029ea02329a022048ab) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Return HTTP 403 with AccountDeactivated error for write operations on deactivated accounts

  Previously, attempting write operations on a deactivated account returned a generic 500 error. Now returns a proper 403 Forbidden with error type "AccountDeactivated", giving clients clear feedback that the account needs to be activated.

- [#44](https://github.com/ascorbic/atproto-worker/pull/44) [`0adeffb`](https://github.com/ascorbic/atproto-worker/commit/0adeffbbca35994317451ecde2830fdf4bb5cb33) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Improvements to CLI prompts and logic

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#33](https://github.com/ascorbic/atproto-worker/pull/33) [`4f5b50c`](https://github.com/ascorbic/atproto-worker/commit/4f5b50c4911514f0f87dc3f3856a2b4e2ccb9b4d) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Implement deactivated account pattern for seamless account migration

  **Account State Management:**
  - Add account activation state tracking to support migration workflows
  - New `INITIAL_ACTIVE` environment variable controls whether accounts start active or deactivated
  - Accounts can transition between active and deactivated states

  **Migration Endpoints:**
  - `POST /xrpc/com.atproto.server.activateAccount` - Enable writes and firehose events
  - `POST /xrpc/com.atproto.server.deactivateAccount` - Disable writes while keeping reads available
  - Enhanced `getAccountStatus` to return actual activation state and migration metrics

  **Write Protection:**
  - Write operations (`createRecord`, `putRecord`, `deleteRecord`, `applyWrites`) are blocked when account is deactivated
  - Returns clear "AccountDeactivated" error with helpful instructions
  - Read operations, `importRepo`, `uploadBlob`, and `activateAccount` remain available

  **Improved Setup Flow:**
  - `pds init` now asks if you're migrating an existing account
  - For migrations: auto-resolves handle to DID, deploys account as deactivated
  - For new accounts: generates identity, deploys as active
  - Worker name automatically generated from handle using smart slugification

  **Migration UX:**
  - Handle resolution using DNS-over-HTTPS via `@atproto-labs/handle-resolver`
  - Retry logic with helpful error messages for failed handle lookups
  - Step-by-step guidance for export, import, PLC update, and activation
  - Custom domain validation to prevent using hosted handles (\*.bsky.social)

  This enables users to safely migrate their Bluesky accounts to self-hosted infrastructure with a clean, resumable workflow.

  This endpoint is required for video uploads. Clients call it to get a service JWT to authenticate with external services like the video service (`did:web:video.bsky.app`).
